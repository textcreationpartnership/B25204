            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p> MAy it please your Majesty, to accept my thanks, for your gracious Act in restoring the <hi>Charter,</hi> surely your Majesty was as an Angel to divert Judgment from your Ancient City, the Lord make your Majesty a Wise Physician to heal the Wounds of this Nation, and I doubt not but that your Majesty has the Nature of an Indulgent Father, who values the Lives and Interest of his Children before the Gain of the World. Therefore I humbly beseech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to make Peace, for <hi>Blessed is the Peace maker,</hi> for why should War obtain that which Peace may do, for it is very destructive, and the Winner may prove a Looser, and it was the Councel of our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our who Exhorted his Disciples to agree with their Adversaries whilst they were in the Way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intreat Your Majesty, to satisfie the <hi>Dutch</hi> if possible, for I find all men in general are willing to fight for your Majesty; but your Majesty cannot blame us if we are not willing to fight for <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they own such Doctrin as Christ and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples never taught, to Judge all to be Heretical and Damn'd but their selves, And yet at the same time own themselves Catholick Christians, which is a clear Contradiction, therefore there is a necessity they should renounce such Errours as these are, to give some assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that whilst we fight your Majesties Battel, we may not promote theirs; then I dare to Promise your Majesty Victory, for we shall have the Spirits of English Men to fight your Battel, but <hi>Rome</hi> darkens your Glory, and the fear of <hi>Popery</hi> has been the sole Cause, of all our Differences; I do not condemn all <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> for I really think that there is Brave and Worthy Men amongst them that will be precious in Gods sight, but yet I think they do not wisely to stand in opposition against Christs Intentions, for he never intended to Exalt the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> but to make God All in All; that we through him and for his sake might obtain the hopes of Salvation. Oh! that it would please God that our Differences were at an end that we might have an happy Unity, which is the Prayer of your humble Subject, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Souls well wisher.</p>
